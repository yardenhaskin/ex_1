            dst_image: Destination image to which the source image is being
            mapped to.
            match_p_src: 2xN points from the source image.
            match_p_dst: 2xN points from the destination image.
            inliers_percent: The expected probability (between 0 and 1) of
            correct match points from the entire list of match points.
            max_err: A scalar that represents the maximum distance (in pixels)
            between the mapped src point to its corresponding dst point,
            in order to be considered as valid inlier.

        Returns:
            A panorama image.
